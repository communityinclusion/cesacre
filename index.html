<h4 id="toc_1">1. Do I have to complete all the College of Employment Services (CES) courses first before doing the CES ACRE Supplement?</h4>

<p>No, you do not have to finish all the CES courses first, unless required by your course administrator. You can work on the CES courses and the CES ACRE Supplement simultaneously.  Due to personal time constraints, most learners choose to complete all the CES courses first, and then spend time on the CES ACRE Supplement work.</p>

<h4 id="toc_2">2. After I complete the work on the CES ACRE Supplement, I will get an ACRE certificate, correct?</h4>

<p>No, that is not correct. You must complete all 11 of the required CES courses <em>and</em> also complete all the activities on the CES ACRE Supplement, to get an ACRE certificate.</p>

<h4 id="toc_3">3. Why do I have to give a copy of my transcripts from the College of Employment Services (CES) to the CES ACRE Supplement staff?</h4>

<h4 id="toc_4">4. Why do I have to log into two different websites with different usernames and passwords to do this program?</h4>

<h4 id="toc_5">5. Why do I have to pay two different fees to get the ACRE certificate?</h4>

<p>Learners are able to pay a fee to the College of Employment Services (CES) and just complete the courses they have paid for to enhance their professional development. There is no requirement for them to proceed any further with their education.</p>

<p>If the learner decides that they do want to continue with their education and get an ACRE certificate, they need to register and pay the additional fee for the CES ACRE Supplement.</p>
